when we use the same dependency injection and inject same instance of service class to parent component and it's child components 
then dependency injection in child component overrides dependency injection of its parent class .

child class provider overrides parent parent class provider.

Instead of providing provider of class in each  child component to access the same instance of a service class we can add provider 
in component class of  a parent component  and use it in each child component.

Providing dependency injection(provider) in header, module and parent component and using them in child component class is called hierarchical 
dependency injection.
